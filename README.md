# Convergence Wordpress Theme
Wordpress Theme for Convergence Design Lab, LLC 

## Framework
Development of the wordpress theme was handled via [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) & a local [wordpress installation](https://wordpress.org/download/) installation. This environment ensures quick reload and use of wp functions. All development should be handled via a localhost. MAMP pushes data to the http://localhost:8888/ port. 

## Installation 
If familar with local development, feel free to use your favorite localhost server. If starting from a vanilla machine without localhost servers, below is a development quickstart: 

- [ ] Download MAMP
- [ ] Download Wordpress
- [ ] Move the unzipped Wordpress folder to MAMP's htdocs
- [ ] Open up MAMP & hit start Server
- [ ] Browser should open up a localhost:8888
- [ ] Go to URL http://localhost:8888/wordpress
- [ ] Wordpress configuration should pop up, select language
- [ ] Make sure your database name is wordpress 
- [ ] Set a username (root) and password (root)
- [ ] Keep database host and table prefex the same
- [ ] Next is a website and user config. Set up the web title as whatever, I would reccomend Convergence Design Lab. Go on !
- [ ] Login to the WP Dashboard with the credentials you just created. If the page takes longer that 15s to load. Reload the page and login again. 
- [ ] Navigate to the wordpress dashboard > Appearance > Themes > Add New > Drag in a zipped version of your Github CDL folder.
